    <h3>Gen Z is in trouble</h3>
  </header>

  <div class="article">


    <p>Gen Z is bright, motivated, and truly passionate about perceived injustices. That is great — yesterday’s children become tomorrow’s leaders.
    <br>
    <br>
    Yet, there is a problem.
    <br>
    <br>
    Beneath that desire is something more latent. Few speak of it, because those who grew up in older generations who were not subjected to social media each hour of each day simply cannot understand. Sympathy works here, but empathy doesn't.
    <br>
    <br>
    The data are clear, too.
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>

    </div>

    <p><br>Common wisdom says students today are confronted with ever-increasingly difficult admissions prospects at the nation’s elite universities. This is true. (Another topic for another time — but that, too, tells smart kids will remain smart no matter where they go.)

    Look again at that chart. As someone who begins college this upcoming fall, these data terrify me. Sure, a reasonable explanation could ascribe the trend to the lack of time to date. In theory that sounds right. Still, for a large portion of Gen Z (especially those with eyes on prestigious universities), this is not the case.
    <br>
    <br>
    In reality, for many in Gen Z, they can’t spend time with friends and develop necessary social skills to date because there truly is not a toolbox with which they can approach social situations.
    <br>
    <br>
    Somethings in life cannot be skipped. Yes, the smart violinist next door who completes Calc II by the end of middle school is rare, but possible. Can someone who can’t make friends, however, end up dating someone by the 10th grade? In nearly every case, no.
    <br>
    <br>
    Let’s use numbers.
    <br>
    <br>
    ‘Back in the day’, every interaction between two 16-year-olds was done either in person or on the phone. Even if the interactions were mostly in the latter category, there was a human aspect to it. Listening and inferring based off inflection and tone, is a developed skill for most people. To relay information, you heard (and/or saw) a human. In this old world, this was the only way.
    <br>
    <br>
    Now, today. Say, arbitrarily, 50% of every word relayed to a friend over the teenage years is now through iMessage or Facebook Messenger. That means the time spent developing those kinds of social skills — listening and having to think of responses on your feet — receive, by rule, half the time.
    <br>
    <br>
    This is a tragedy — anecdotally, in my own life, this trend has ended friendships, propelled feelings of doubt, and, before I made amends to fix it, filled my teenage years with feelings of emptiness. You will not find this to be atypical of my generation.
    <br>
    <br>
    Ultimately, when those skills are not developed in their entirety, of course Gen Z cannot date. It is the first generation which, I would argue, grew up in what is effectively a different universe.
    <br>
    <br>
    Gen Z is segregated.
    <br>
    <br>
    It’s always been the case: people tend towards those who have similar interests and values. Gen Z is no exception.
    <br>
    <br>
    This time, though, the ‘smart kids’ no longer have to interact with the so-called ‘average kids’. Digital technology has encapsulated youth in all levels. Instead of heading out to the movies on a Friday night, kids stay home messaging rather than talking.
    <br>
    <br>
    The real world is going to be wholly unmoved and without regard for teens who grew up in a world which could not foster those social skills. But that is the reality of today.
    <br>
    <br>
    What happens when life exposes young adults incapable of hearing out other people to those with such different views? Berkeley and Middlebury spring to mind.
    <br>
    <br>
    Millennials are slowly pushing Gen X-ers and Boomers out of positions of power. With that, Gen Z is entering the workforce for the first time out of college. Political polarization is going to get worse, not better, if nothing is done.
    <br>
    <br>
    Triumph amid despair.
    So the question is, how do we fix it? Of course, it’s a complicated question with many possible answers.
    <br>
    <br>
    You can find anecdotes of Silicon Valley parents effectively eliminating screen time from their kids’ daily lives.
    <br>
    <br>
    I think it’s the right choice.
    <br>
    <br>
    Last year, between my Junior and Senior year of high school, I decided that enough was enough. I would attempt to make up for all those lost years of too many hours in front of the computer screen.
    <br>
    <br>
    I began asking people I knew to meet at the local Starbucks without an agenda, just to sit there and talk about anything that came to mind. It was fascinating. The first time I sat down with a friend for five hours. The next day, I met with another person — this time, eight hours. I kept it going.
    <br>
    <br>
    Any meet-up under two hours became a real disappointment.
    <br>
    <br>
    A realization became clear: I need, at minimum, three hours uninterrupted to really get to know someone.
    <br>
    <br>
    Young people enjoy listening to Joe Rogan for the same reason. They are finally exposed to something not only enjoyable, but something needed. The need to hear to real humans.
    <br>
    <br>
    After several months of this, I felt more confident, more potent socially, and better with words. It did and continues to help immensely with learning the social skills which I should have learned so many years ago.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have hope for the future.
    <br>
    <br>
    Recently, I corresponded with Jon Haidt. He said Gen Z is not in denial — I agree. The conversations I’ve had between other Gen Z-ers and I came to the same conclusion.
    <br>
    <br>
    We need to talk more, face-to-face, uninterrupted, without structure, allowing a natural ebb-and-flow.
    <br>
    <br>
    It’s a simple solution, but one I’ve seen to be the right one.</p>
