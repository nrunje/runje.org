    <h3>Reflections on One-Half of 2020</h3>
  </header>

  <div class="article">


    <p>14 June 2020
  <br>
  <br>
  We are not even halfway through the year, but I think we can all agree on something: 2020 has been unexpected.
  <br>
  <br>
  I first need to go back to June of last year as a high school senior. Before then, graduating was a part of my life that always seemed so far away. When you’re a high schooler hoping to someday enter a good college and so focused on day-to-day assignments and studies, sometimes the bigger picture starts to fade away—what and where do I hope to pursue my post-college career?—which relationships are worth maintaining?—what kind of life do I want to live? These are our most difficult questions and ones that can take a lifetime to answer, yet they are our most important.
  <br>
  <br>
  During that week in March when civilization itself seemingly came to a stop—with students sent home, businesses shuttered, professional aspirations halted—I realized an important fact: life is fragile and the very foundation of society walks a thin line between order and chaos. Economists and sociologists often speak of “skilled labor” and “unskilled labor” as if the latter is non-essential. Yet this year, with resounding force, has shown that both categories form inextricable links between one another. A hedge fund manager in Manhattan cannot complete his or her job if food production in small-town Kansas ceases. In light of this, Cosmopolitanism can be seen in two ways: a metaphor for how we ought to treat other people or, as I believe, another form of pragmatism that 1) creates empathy for others and 2) creates a-political solutions to a-political problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  I cannot also reflect on 2020 so far without commenting on the recent protests taking form in the United States and around the world. Protestors in Tokyo, London, New York, and Los Angeles (among many others) have taken to the street to voice their support for the black community. It is too early to tell the ultimate impact these protests will have on the relationship between the public and law enforcement, but I think there will be changes. The most important part is the start of a global conversation, as humans solve things when they talk to other humans.
  <br>
  <br>
  I am hopeful for the future.</p>
